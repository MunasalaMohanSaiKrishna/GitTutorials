# 03 - BigQuery ML (BQML)
Machine Learning with SQL using [BigQuery ML (BQML)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/introduction).

- [03Tools - Pipelines Example 3](03Tools%20-%20Pipelines%20Example%203.ipynb)

**Notes:**
- Each of the notebooks=experiments `03a` through `03i` create a model in BigQuery with BQML and register the model in Vertex AI Model Registry.  Rerunning the notebook will create a new model version in the Vertex AI Model Registry.  All versions of the model persist in BigQuery and a timestamp is used to maintain naming uniqueness in BigQuery.
    - This recent integration between BQML models and Vertex AI Model Registry will result in an update to this work.
- `03Tools - Prediction` allows you to specify any experiment in this series and it will upload the latest version of the model to a Vertex AI Endpoint and demonstrate requesting predictions with Python, REST, and the GCLOUD CLI.
- Each of the `03Tools Pipelines ...` notebooks demonstrate an ML Workflow using BQML models with Vertex AI Pipelines
    - `Example 1`: Deploy The Best Model To An Endpoint
    - `Example 2`: Conditionally Update Endpoint
    - `Example 3`: Retraining Tournament
