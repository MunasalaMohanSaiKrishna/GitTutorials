# 05 - Custom Models: TensorFlow
This series of notebooks highlights the use of Vertex AI for machine learning workflows with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).  The same simple model specification is used for all examples with the focus put on workflows for different ML workflows and operational tasks.  The goal is to provide a starting point that can be used with the model architecture you already have.

>**NOTE:** The notebooks in the `05 - TensorFlow` series demonstrate training, serving and operations for TensorFlow models and take advantage of [Vertex AI TensorBoard](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-overview) to track training across experiments.  Running these notebooks will create a Vertex AI TensorBoard instance which has a user-based montly pricing that is different than other services that charge by usage.  This cost is $300 per user - [Vertex AI Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#tensorboard).

**Notes:**
- Vertex AI Training > Custom Jobs run ML training code in a serverless environment:
    - This is featured in notebooks `05a`, `05b` and `05c`
- Vertex AI Training > Training Jobs run ML training code and register the resulting model in Vertex AI Model Registry:
    - This is featured in notebooks `05d`, `05e` and `05f`
- Vertex AI Training > Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs run ML training code and focus in on the best values for hyperparamters:
    - This is featured in notebooks `05g`, `05h`, and `05i`
- Each type of job can be specified with:
    - a single Python script: featured in notebooks `05a`, `05d`, and `05g`
    - a Python source distribution: featured in notebooks `05b`, `05e`, and `05h`
    - a custom container: featured in notebooks `05c`, `05f`, and `05i`
- [`./codetrain.py`](./code/train.py) is the script used for all:
    - Vertex AI Training > Custom Jobs: `05a`, `05b` and `05c` 
    - Vertex AI Training > Training Jobs: `05d`, `05e` and `05f`
- [`./code/hp_train.py`](./code/hp_train.py) is the script used for all:
    - Vertex AI Training > Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs: `05g`, `05h`, and `05i`
- Example `05a` through `05i` all:
    - Work as Experiments, each time they are run they log as an experiment run
    - Write TensorFlow callbacks to hosted TensorBoard
    - Can be run multiple times and each time will update the resulting model as a new version in the Vertex AI Model Registry.  The model name is unique to the notebook=experiment.
